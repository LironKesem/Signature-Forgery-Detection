[One-Shot Signature Recognition Using Siamese Networks](https://github.com/shakti365/Signature-Forgery-Detection/blob/master/One-Shot%20Signature%20Recognition%20Using%20Siamese%20Networks.md)

## Getting Started

- create a `python 2.7` virtual environment and activate it

- install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`

- download the data from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lhwcRhxzJ6BC5SUSRALRdCNKo4B4rwa1/view?usp=sharing) and store it in `data/raw`

- extract the `Dataset_Signature_Final.zip` file and store it in `data/raw`

- run the script to clean and store data in `data/interim`
```python
cd src/data
python clean.py
```
